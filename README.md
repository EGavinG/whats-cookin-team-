### Context
As mod2 students in the Turing program (starting week 3 of the program), we worked on this project as a group of 3 over the time period of 11 days (Dec 1 - Dec 11). We utilized HTML, ES6 JavaScript, and CSS to build the project. We leveraged collaborative tools such as Zoom and Slack huddles to tackle problems synchronously, as well as working asynchronously to develop the project.

### Wins and Challenges
One of the biggest challenges we faced was getting our initial footing when working together on the project as a group. There were hurdles to understanding and working with each other's code at first, and this pushed our progress expectations further back than we planned, but once we got past that hurdle, we hit a stride and cruised through the later iterations. 

During those first few days of rough progress, another of our biggest challenges was getting the recipe page and the functions associated with populating the correct data and injecting it into the HTML to work properly.

Developing code asynchronously, then coming together to debug and refactor the code synchronously was the approach that worked best for our group. We were able to complete the required iterations, debug the project before the project deadline, and gain more experience in a time sensitive, group setting as developers.
